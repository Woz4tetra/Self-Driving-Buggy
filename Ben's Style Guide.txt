- modules (files), functions, and variables use underscore (buggy_info, video_maker)
- classes and methods use camel case
- use assert statements to confirm the inputs and outputs of functions (might been too slow. doc strings might be sufficient)
- put doc strings with the following at the top of the file and have them display when the program runs:

Program name
=========

Description

Usage
-----
filename parameter1 [parameter2] ('[' means optional)

Keys
----
  1-7   - something
  SPACE - something else
  ESC   - exit

- use python's commenting format for each function:
def function():
	'''
        Description

        :param something: (mention type) something interesting
	:return: (mention type) something else interesting
	'''
