Whohoo! Kalman Filters!

Okay so I have no idea what I'm doing, 
but I've got kalman_test.ipynb running in jupyter, which is p cool.
kaman_test.ipynb (ipython notebook) does some stuff

Stuff includes:
Read Dataset1.csv
Graph Dataset1.csv
Import pykalman

So there's still a bunch more to do, like get that to run in Sublime
because apperently we have sublime running Python3
but jupyter is running miniconda, and has pandas?

I need to figure out how to import libraries, 
because this is harder than it was for javascript.
